I really dont like conflict. I don't necessarily avoid it like the plague, but I do not enjoy having conflict in my life. Whether it be personal or professional, and for the most part, I just wish everyone could always get along.

> 1.  Be impeccable with your word.
> Words have immeasurable power, so use them with care. Say only what you mean, and remember your opinion isn't fact. Silence is better than saying something you'll regret.
>
> 2.  Don't take anything personally.
> Here I'll quote the book, "Nothing other people do is because of you. It is because of themselves. That guy honking at you just spilled scalding coffee all over his lap, the boss screaming at you is going through a divorce. Their stuff has nothing to do with your stuff, and assuming you're the root cause of someone's behavior is not only self-centered, it's also a big waste of energy.
>
> 3.  Don't make assumptions.
> You can spend hours generating theories about why someone did something, or you can just ask. When someone lashes or does something unexpected, save time by seeking clarification.
>
> 4.  Do your best.
> Do the best you can with the conflict in front of you, and you won't need to waste brain power on self-judgements or regrets.


I see where she's going with this and these are definitely things I need to keep in the forefront of my mind during daily dealings with people.
