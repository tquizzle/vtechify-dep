Today I really needed to jump on a P to V conversion. This hardware was dropped in my lap and I didnt have much time to get it configured. As luck would have it, I also couldn’t connect to the ADMIN$ share. Which means that the vCenter Standalone Converter couldn’t copy the files necessary to install the agent and begin the conversion. Thanks to [cat brain | grep interesting](http://www.userdel.com/post/3345504444/manually-install-vmware-converter-agent-for-windows), I was able to quickly get this going.

> On the server you have VMWare Converter standalone installed, go to “C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware vCenter Converter Standalone” – obviously substitute the correct driver letter and if you’re not on a 64bit box you can remove the “(x86)” part.
Find the file named “VMware-Converter-Agent.exe” and copy it over to the Windows box.
Run the executable you copied.
