So I've been having issues seeing things properly using the default color scheme in PuTTY. I couldn't quite make out the folder text because the font color was such a dark blue that it blended into the black background.

Thanks to Google, I found exactly what I needed to change. A bit cumbersome at first, but if you spend any serious time in a client such as this it makes all the world of difference.
