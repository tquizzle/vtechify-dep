By default, many of us probably have our VMs check for new versions of VMTools upon each power cycle. That's usually fine, but in some scenarios it's not. Rather than change the global policy, this script will change just the VMs you want to not upgrade automatically.

{% highlight powershell %}
Get-VM -Name <vmNamesHere> | Get-View | ForEach-Object {
  Write-Output $_.name
  if ($_.config.tools.toolsUpgradePolicy -ne "manual"){
    $vm = Get-VM -Name $_.name
    $spec = New-Object VMware.Vim.VirtualMachineConfigSpec
    $spec.tools = New-Object VMware.Vim.ToolsConfigInfo
    $spec.tools.toolsUpgradePolicy = "manual"
    $_this = Get-View -Id $vm.Id
    $_this.ReconfigVM_Task($spec)
    Write-Output "Completed"
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
