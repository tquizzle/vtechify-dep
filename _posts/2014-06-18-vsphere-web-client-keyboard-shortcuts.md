The guy over at vSpace outlined some very handy keyboard shortcuts for use while in the vSphere Web Client.

I havenâ€™t completely made the switch from the C# client to the Web Client, but this might help nudge me in the right direction.

>I recently learned about a few cool VMware vSphere Web Client keyboard shortcuts to jump to between different views. The screenshot below provides a quick overview of the available keyboard shortcuts for the vSphere Web Client. Take a look at the table below for a more detailed break down of each keyboard shortcut. The following table lists the shortcuts that the vSphere Web Client supplies. Because it is browser-based and runs within multiple operating environments, the vSphere Web Client defines few keyboard shortcuts.


| Keyboard Operation | Action |
|:--------|:--------|
| Ctrl+Alt+S | Place cursor in the Search field control |
|Ctrl+Alt+1 OR Ctrl+Alt+Home|Navigates to the vSphere Web Client home|
|Ctrl+Alt+2|Navigate to the vCenter Home inventory|
|Ctrl+Alt+3|Navigate to the Hosts & Clusters tree in the vCenter inventory|
|Ctrl+Alt+4|Navigate to the VMs & Templates tree in the vCenter inventory|
|Ctrl+Alt+5|Navigate to the Storage tree in the vCenter inventory|
|Ctrl+Alt+6|Navigate to the Networking tree in the vCenter inventory|
