![Windows 10 - Update Screen][1]

In [an article on Digital Trends.com](http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/microsoft-promises-an-end-to-an-era-as-patch-tuesday-taken-to-the-shed/), Chris Stobing writes about Microsoft's new patching strategy.

> "At this rate, we may not even recognize Windows in the next few years."

After reading his article, it sums up my sentiments exactly.

> ...according to a presentation from the company’s own Terry Myerson, the release of Windows 10 will usher in a much more consistent update schedule, one which adapts to threats as they happen in the moment, rather than waiting 30 days every time an issue needs to be addressed.

> The update schedule won’t just apply to desktops, either, covering tablets and phones installed with the upcoming OS just as equally as their larger, heavier cousins.

Thanks Microsoft. We needed this. You **needed** this.
