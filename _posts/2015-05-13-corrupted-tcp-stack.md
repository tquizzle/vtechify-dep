Today while troubleshooting an unpingable VM, there was just something not right about it.

We checked everything we could think of, then double-checked.

- distributed port group is good
- upstream switches are good
- other VMs on same host and network are good
- VM was good before last reboot...hmm

So that last one...seems that something went wrong once the VM tried to reboot after Microsoft patches.

After trying several things (I wont go into what all we tried) we stumbled across [this](http://technicalpath.blogspot.com/2008/06/case-of-corrupted-tcp-stack.html).

IPSec? Yes, it got jacked - polstore.dll somehow was corrupted.

1. Delete HKLM\Software\Microsoft\IPSec
2. From command prompt
  - Unregister the faulty driver: **regsvr32 /u polstore.dll**
  - Register the dll back to the system: **regsvr32 polstore.dll**
3. Reboot

Problem solved.
