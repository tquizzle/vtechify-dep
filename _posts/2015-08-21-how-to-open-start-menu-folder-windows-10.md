You know Microsoft couldn't leave well enough alone, so they made it difficult to find the Start Menu folder.

Silly Microsoft. Don't make the adoption of your newly OS so difficult to navigate for long-time Windows users.

Here's how to find "your" or a "specific" user's start menu folder


![Windows 10 - Specific Users Start Menu Folder][1]

{% highlight bash %} 
%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu
{% endhighlight %}

And then what about the "All User's" Start Menu Folder?


![Windows 10 - All Users Start Menu Folder][2]

{% highlight bash %} 
%ProgramData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu
{% endhighlight %}
