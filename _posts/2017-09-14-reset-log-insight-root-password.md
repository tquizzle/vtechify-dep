The other day I did the inevitable, I forgot the root password to my vRealize Log Insight appliance. Lucky for me, this can be reset using the vSphere Web Client.

### Reset the Log Insight Password
1. Power off the Log Insight appliance by choosing "Shut Down Guest OS".
2. Edit it's settings once it's off.

Now, go forth and Log!
