Yesterday I finally ran the native OSX installer for the 6.5 version of VCSA. During deployment, I kept getting errors about ovftool. I couldn't figure this out initially as I had the ovftool already installed and it was the latest version.

I sought out to add it to my PATH thinking that this would solve it. I was wrong again.

I stumbled onto a [blog post](http://sflanders.net/2016/11/18/vcsa-6-5-installer-gotchas/) by [Steve Flanders](http://twitter.com/smflanders) that explained some gotchas for the Mac installer on Sierra.

Here's what I saw...

* Open CDROM > vcsa-ui-installer > mac > Installer.app
* Complete steps 1 through 5
* Hit an error on step 6
![Step 6 Error]({{ site.url }}/images/vcsa-mac-ovftool1.png)

As Steve wrote, I figured I too had a corrupted OVA or installer ISO file.
I downloaded it all again...same result.
Clicking the "Show All" button, gives this:
![ovftool not available]({{ site.url }}/images/vcsa-mac-ovftool2.png)

So then I click on "Installer Log" and look into it.
I see something like this:

{% highlight bash %}
2017-09-13T21:55:20.116Z - error: could not find ovftoolCmd: /private/var/folders/zq/hv4wdw2n431fgt2fvwyxk46jyy3clj/T/AppTranslocation/vcsa/ovftool/mac/ovftool
2017-09-13T21:55:20.116Z - info: ovftoolCmd: null
2017-09-13T21:55:20.116Z - error: OVF probe error: Error: ovftool is not available
{% endhighlight %}

So it cant find the ovftool? Weird. So maybe I can fix that.
Just copy the `vcsa` folder to that private path...
`/private/var/folders/zq/hv4wdw2n431fgt2fvwyxk46jyy3clj/T/AppTranslocation`

Now try the installer again and you should have success!

Yay Internet!
