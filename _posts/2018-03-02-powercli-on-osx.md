There have been a few posts out there talking about how to install PowerCLI on OSX so I figured I'd just make my own post about what I did.


### HomeBrew

You should already have [this](https://brew.sh/). If not, find out about it and make it happen.

Now you need to add [HomeBrew-Cask](https://caskroom.github.io/) so you can get more goodies from HomeBrew.

{% highlight bash %}
brew tap caskroom/cask
{% endhighlight %}

Now install PowerShell

{% highlight bash %}
brew cask install powershell
{% endhighlight %}

Does it work?

{% highlight bash %}
pwsh
{% endhighlight %}

### PowerCLI

Now we can easily install PowerCLI.

{% highlight powershell %}
Install-Module -Name VMware.PowerCLI -Scope CurrentUser
{% endhighlight %}


#### Default certificate handling

Now we get errors when connecting to a vCenter with self-signed certificates.
We'll have to fix that!

{% highlight powershell %}
Set-PowerCLIConfiguration -InvalidCertificateAction Ignore
{% endhighlight %}
